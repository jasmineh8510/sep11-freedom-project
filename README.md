# SEP11 Freedom Project
by Jasmine Hidalgo

## Context
The "Freedom Project" for SEP11 is all about making something you want to make. The purpose of this blog is to keep track of my process throughout the making of this project.

## Content
For my project, I am making a pinball game. This blog will walk through my process of independently studying p5js in order to make my pinball game. Although pinball was not my first idea, I learned more and I improvised.
