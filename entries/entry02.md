Over the past few weeks I have been learning my tool, p5js. I can say that I learnt many things during the past weeks. My sources for learning have been the [reference page on p5js](https://p5js.org/reference/) and [The Coding Train](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLglp04UYZK_PrN6xWo_nJ-8kzyXDyFUwi) on youtube who has a whole playlist of videos about p5js.
